# Weather Program

This program is written in C# and is intended to fetch weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

## Usage

For the program to work, an API-key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) needs to be put in the projects build directory or assigned during runtime.
When the program starts, you will need to specify what location to fetch the data from. OpenWeatherMap's API will then fetch the data and print it out in the console and write to a file in the projects build directory.

## Installation

First clone the repository

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/nusbog/WeatherProgram
```

Compile and run the program

```cmd
dotnet run
```
